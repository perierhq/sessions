/**
 * The two floating action buttons — what used to be `mobile-fab` and
 * `desk-fab` in legacy.css.
 *
 * They are a pair, and the numbers only make sense read together: on a phone
 * the new-session + sits 12px from the right edge at 58px across, and the Desk
 * trigger sits one 12px gutter further in — which is why its phone `right` is
 * still spelled `calc(12px + 58px + 12px)` rather than the 82px it resolves
 * to. Both ride z-500: above the content, below the action sheet (4000) and
 * the palettes (6000).
 *
 * Every phone value is a `phone:` variant rather than an unprefixed base with
 * a `desktop:` undo. The Desk FAB genuinely has two looks (a quiet 44px
 * outline on desktop, a 58px shadowed twin of the + on phones) and the
 * new-session + does not exist above the breakpoint at all, so writing the
 * phone look as the base would leave desktop reading values it never had.
 *
 * `rounded-full` is deliberate on both, and is the one radius spelling that
 * opts OUT of the app's squircle: these were authored as a bare
 * `border-radius: 50%`, i.e. a true circle, not a scaled corner. Anything in
 * the chrome that squircles wants `rounded-[999px]` instead.
 */

/**
 * Phones only: the new-session + in the thumb corner of the root list.
 * App.tsx already gates it on `!mobileDetail`; `hidden` covers desktop, where
 * the sidebar's own + does the job.
 *
 * The shadow is deliberately shallower than the ambient-occlusion stack a
 * material FAB carries: this button is solid ink on a near-white page, so a
 * 20px/0.3 spread read as a smudge under it rather than as lift. iOS floats
 * controls on a tight contact shadow plus a short soft one, which is what these
 * two layers are — and the same pair, lightened for an outlined white surface,
 * is what the Desk trigger beside it now uses.

/**
 * The ⌘J Desk trigger. Desktop uses the same resting shadow and border as the
 * Next button, then lifts a pixel and warms the glyph on hover. Phones cancel
 * the lift (there is no pointer to lift under) and swap it for the same press
 * tick the + uses. `transition` lists the properties the states actually move.
 * `scale` and `translate` are their own properties in Tailwind v4, so a bare
 * `transform` in the list would animate neither.
 *
 * On phones it keeps its border, so it needs less shadow than the + to sit off
 * the page. A matched pair of deep shadows made the two read as one heavy
 * slab. This is the desktop shadow's weight, spread for the bigger circle.
 *
 * It takes the composer's surface pair rather than --bg-panel for the same
 * reason the composer does: the ramp steps away from the page, so a panel fill
 * put a grey disc on a white page, like a hole rather than a lifted control.
 * White with a firmer edge (--composer-border, not --border) is how a raised
 * surface behaves in light. In dark the pair resolves to --control-surface,
 * which is lighter than the page and lifts on its own.
 *
 * On desktop, useDeskFabPosition supplies `left` and `bottom` while a composer
 * is visible. It keeps this corner position while there is room and moves the
 * trigger directly above the composer when the pane reaches the viewport edge.
 * The default declarations below cover pages without a composer and browsers
 * before the first measurement. Phones override them with the paired FAB
 * layout from the right edge.
