/**
 * Interactive AskUserQuestion card — the agent is waiting on these answers.
 *
 * Behaviour comes from the headless `@shadcn/react` Questionnaire; the optics
 * are ours. That split is the point: the parts give us a real `fieldset` per
 * question, native radios and checkboxes, arrow-key movement between answers,
 * letter shortcuts, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to send, and an error region that announces
 * — none of which the old hand-rolled `aria-pressed` buttons had. Every class
 * below is still this app's own, so nothing about the card's surface changed.
 *
 * Surfaces: one raised card on the transcript — no outline of its own, the
 * surface step is the edge — with the choices as control-surface rows on top
 * of it. Deliberately two surfaces, not the three nested greys it used to wear
 * (card → section → row), which read as boxes-in-boxes.
 *
 * Selection is NEUTRAL, not accent: the accent is red here, and filling a
 * chosen row with it read as an error/warning rather than a pick. Same reason
 * the composer keeps its resting border on focus (see .composer in legacy.css).
 * It also doesn't tint the row at all — the filled indicator carries it, with
 * the hairline stepping up. The indicator is a circle for single-select and a
 * rounded square for multi-select, so the shape says how many answers are
 * allowed.
 *
 * Two things the primitive can't know about this surface:
 *
 *  - We ship no Tailwind Preflight, so the `fieldset` it renders arrives with
 *    the UA's border, margin and padding — zeroed on the item below, the same
 *    way the free-text field has to zero its own inset border.
 *  - It hides an inactive item with the `hidden` attribute, and a `flex` class
 *    beats the UA's `[hidden]` rule. `[&[hidden]]:hidden` is a class plus an
 *    attribute, so it wins back.
 *
 * Picking is never sending. A click on an option, or its letter, only selects
 * it, on a lone question exactly as on a stepped one: the pick can still be
 * changed, or replaced by a typed answer, before anything leaves. Sending is
 * always a second, deliberate act: the Answer button, Enter on the picked row
 * or in the field, or Cmd/Ctrl+Enter. A single click that answered on the
 * spot made a slip of the pointer an answer the agent had already acted on.
 *
 * The letters are the keyboard's click. The primitive answers to A, B, C…
 * only while the form holds focus, but a question lands while you are reading
 * the transcript or sitting in the composer, so the card also listens on the
 * window: a bare letter from anywhere that is not a text field picks that
 * option and moves focus to its row, so Enter sends it from there. The
 * composer is the one place the letters cannot reach (they are typing there),
 * so the `ask-focus` chord brings the keyboard to the card instead.
